# Kafeku API V1 Documentation

Oh boy, are you excited to use this API? I know I am.

This API is a work of art, a masterpiece, a symphony of code that will change your life forever.

Or maybe it's just a bunch of endpoints that kinda work most of the time.

Either way, you're stuck with this code, so you might as well use it.

## Endpoints

### Users

* `/users/`: Get all users (disconnected and connected)

### Desks

* `/desks/`: Get all desks (empty and occupied)

## How to use

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
4. Go to `http://localhost:8000/docs` to see the API documentation
5. Cry tears of joy (or sadness) when you realize how terrible this API is
